# Description
This is a list of templates that I use everyday with the Obsidian note-taking program. Let Templater plugin render the templates, and you're good to go.

1. Generic Fleeting Thoughts
> All atomic notes will be structured using this

2. Meeting Notes
> Template I use to take meeting notes

3. Cornell Notes Training/Seminar
> Template I use when I take classes or Seminars

4. Book Notes
> Whenever I finish a book, I try to note down the information I've listed in the template to give insight to other people what I found in this book. Some ideas would definitely later be atomized.

5. Blog Checklist Post
> To be frank, I have not used this template, but it's a good enough checklist

6. Zotero Notes
> I've experimented quite a lot with the Nunjucks templating, and the result is quite good!
> You just need to use the Annotations in Zotero, and you're pretty much able to download everything from Zotero to Obsidian with the integration plugin

# Why am I sharing something so light?
I just want to share it to other people, just so that if they do stumble upon this, they'd at least be inspired for their own template :)
